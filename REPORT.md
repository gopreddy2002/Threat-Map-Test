# Threat Map Complete Project Latest 2026

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What is ThreatMap**
ThreatMap is a premium, full-stack Threat Intelligence platform designed to aggregate, analyze, and visualize Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IPs, Domains, URLs, Hashes, and CVEs. It acts as a single pane of glass for security analysts to triage threats without manually querying dozens of different services.

**Purpose and Goals**
The primary goal of ThreatMap is to accelerate incident response and threat hunting. By combining deterministic data from industry-leading OSINT feeds with generative AI, ThreatMap automatically correlates infrastructure, attributes attacks to known Threat Actors, maps behaviors to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and generates plain-English mitigation strategies.

**Who it is for**
- **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysts:** For rapid IOC triage and alert validation.
- **Threat Hunters:** To uncover correlated infrastructure and track adversary campaigns.
- **Incident Responders:** To generate immediate containment strategies using AI.
- **Security Engineers:** To manage watchlists and track organizational threat exposure.

**Version and Date**
- **Version:** 1.0.0 (Release Candidate)
- **Date:** June 2026

## 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons, React Query.
- **Backend:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy (ORM), Pydantic.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Primary Data Store).
- **Caching:** Redis (In-memory caching for external API responses to prevent rate limiting).
- **AI/ML:** Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (via Vertex AI / Google AI Studio).

```

**Database Design**
The database is built on PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy. It features tables for scanning history, watchlist management, threat actor profiles, community notes, and cached correlations. The design ensures that historical scans are immutable and that relationships (like many-to-many actor attributions) are properly indexed.

**Caching Layer**
Redis is implemented as an essential middleware. Every external API call (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, etc.) is wrapped in a caching function with a default TTL (Time To Live) of 24 hours. This drastically reduces API quota consumption and drops response times for known IOCs from ~5 seconds to < 50 milliseconds.

**Deployment Setup**
- **Frontend:** Node.js environment (can be hosted on Vercel or local Node server).
- **Backend:** Python virtual environment running Uvicorn workers.
- **Data Layer:** Local or managed instances of PostgreSQL and Redis.

## 7. KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

- **Free Tier API Limits:** Heavy usage will rapidly exhaust the VirusTotal (4 requests/min) and Shodan quotas. The Redis cache mitigates this, but bulk scanning > 5 IOCs simultaneously on free tiers will result in HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.
- **Windows IPv6 Delay Issue:** Python `aiohttp` and `urllib` on Windows can sometimes experience 2-second delays resolving `localhost` via IPv6. Connecting explicitly to `127.0.0.1` or disabling IPv6 locally resolves this.
- **Gemini Quota:** Google Gemini free tier has a 15 Request Per Minute limit. If exceeded, the AI mitigation brief will fail gracefully and display a "Rate Limit Reached" fallback message.
- **URLScan Delays:** URLScan processes requests asynchronously. The backend waits up to 10 seconds, but if URLScan is under heavy load, the screenshot may timeout and not appear in the initial report.

---

## 8. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- **SpiderFoot Integration:** Fully integrate the local SpiderFoot REST API into the dashboard to trigger deep OSINT footprinting directly from the UI without leaving ThreatMap.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Containerize the application using Docker Compose and deploy to Railway or AWS ECS for high availability.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Implement JWT authentication to allow multiple analysts to maintain private watchlists and notes.
- **Webhook Alerts:** Push notifications to Slack/Discord when an IOC on the watchlist suddenly spikes in its risk score.
