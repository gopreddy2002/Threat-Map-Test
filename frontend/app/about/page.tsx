          <p>
            ThreatMap is a centralized OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) aggregation platform designed to streamline incident response and threat hunting. Instead of manually querying dozens of separate security websites, ThreatMap queries them all simultaneously, correlates the data, and utilizes a deterministic Risk Engine paired with AI summarization to deliver a single, unified threat report.
          </p>
          <p>
            This platform is built for <strong>Security Researchers, SOC Analysts, Students, and Developers</strong> who need rapid, accurate intelligence on suspicious IP addresses, domains, URLs, and file hashes. It provides enterprise-grade visualization tools like interactive network graphs, global threat maps, and radar charts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind the scenes, ThreatMap leverages asynchronous Python architecture (FastAPI) to parallelize external API calls, ensuring high-speed data retrieval. The Next.js frontend presents this dense data in an intuitive, dark-themed dashboard modeled after professional security operations centers.
